        <h1 class="title">Experience</h1>
        <p class="prg">Everyone has a story; it is rare, and it is captivating. At NTS Films we believe your film should be too. Years from now you should look back at your wedding video and have all of those precious memories come flooding back. Those memories of shoving cake in your spouse’s faces, your grandmother tearing up at the ceremony, you and your spouse saying I do, the smiles of everyone on the dance floor. Pictures can capture these moments; a video can make them last forever.</p>

        <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="prg">My name is Tanner, videography has always been a precious part of my life. Ever since I had my first camera, I’ve wanted to make videos and now I can do that for a living. Over the course of only a few years NTS Films has been able to make over 50 different videos such as weddings, bridals, business, sports, quinceras, promotional, and real estate, and we’ve been able to travel to California, Arizona, Utah, and Idaho. We are devoted to delivering the highest quality product at an affordable price. I truly love what I do and I believe it shows in our work.</p>
